A LLM app personalized to my job application history.

## Motivation

I have applied to more than 30 applications in the past 20 days.

The job tracker spreadsheet has job posting link, job tile, referral status and application status.

I believe a RAG application will be a helpful guide to get clarity with the types of job I have been applying.

The app will compare a new job description to old ones to find similarities, which is a good hint to reuse resume from a previous job application.

Job descriptions are available as web links or pdf print of the job posting webpage.

## data available

job application folder. Each folder contains:

1. Job description pdf (almost all job apping folder have it)
2. Resume

Job tracker spreadsheet.

Job posting webpage (if it is still live)
